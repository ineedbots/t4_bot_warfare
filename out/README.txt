# T4M Bot Warfare
Bot Warfare is a GSC mod for the T4M project.

It aims to add playable AI to the multiplayer games of World at War.

You can find the more information at the Git Repo: https://github.com/ineedbots/t4m_bot_warfare

**Important to public dedicated servers**
The 'bots_main_firstIsHost' DVAR is enabled by default!
This is so inexperienced users of the mod can access with menu without any configuration.
Make sure to disable this DVAR by adding 'set bots_main_firstIsHost 0' in your server config!

## Installation
T4M requires an unpacked steamless version of the multiplayer World at War executable (otherwise known as LanFixed). You can use a Steam Unpacker on your multiplayer World at War Steam executable to acquire the required executable.

0. Make sure that T4M is installed, updated and working properly.
1. Extract all the files from the Bot Warfare release archive you downloaded to anywhere on your computer.
2. Run the 'install.bat'. This copies the mod to your WaW mods folder.
3. The mod is now installed, now run your game.
    - If you are a dedicated server, you will need to set the DVAR 'fs_game' to 'mods/mp_bots'
    - If you are not a dedicated server, open the 'Mods' option from the main menu of the game and select 'mp_bots' and then 'Launch'.
4. The mod should be loaded! Now go start a map and play!
